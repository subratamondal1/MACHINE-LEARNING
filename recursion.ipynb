Iteration vs Recursion\n","**Note:** Recursive Call == Recursive Function\n","### Iteration\n","* Example: given a positive number N, print from N to 1 i.e if N=5 then print 5,4,3,2,1\n","1. **Working Principle:** In iteration we need to initialize the `loop control variable` and increment or decrement it based on the need, and to run the code inside the loop the ` loop control variable` is checked against the `termination condition` i.e until the termination condition is true the inner statement of the loop will continuously execute.\n","2. **Control Variable and Termination Logic:** In iteration the value of the Control Variable continuously move towards the Termination Logic.\n","3. **Storage:** In iteration, the Control Variable stores the value and it is incremented or decremented based on need, and the updated value of the Control Variable will be checked with the Termination Condition.\n","4. **Workings with Infinite Loop:** In iteration, when the Control Variable doesn't move towards the Termination Condition or there is no Termination Condition then the Loop will execute infinitely and it will consumes a lot of CPU cycles (the computer crashes, hangs) until we stop the execution manually\n","\n","### Recursion\n","* Example: given a positive number N, print from N to 1 i.e if N=5 then print 5,4,3,2,1\n","1. **Working Principle:** Whereas, in recursion the function will call itself to solve the problem so the recursion must have a Base Case i.e the termination condition to stop the function from calling itself and causing stack overflow. Until the Base Case is reached the function will call itself to solve the problem.\n","2. **Control Variable and Termination Logic:** Whereas, in recursion the Recursive Call (Control Variable) will move towards the Base Case (Termination Condition)\n","3. **Storage:** Whereas, in recursion, state of every Recursive Call will be stored and maintained in the Stack Memory and when the Base Case is
