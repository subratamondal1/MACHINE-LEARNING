A REST API allows different applications or devices to communicate with each other using standard methods like GET, POST, PUT and DELETE.\n","\n","* **JSON:** JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a data format that is commonly used by REST APIs to exchange information between a client and a server. A REST API can use different data formats to transfer information between the client and the server, but JSON is preferred by many developers because it is lightweight and easy to parse.\n","\n","* **Endpoint:** An endpoint is a URL that defines how a client can access a resource or perform an operation on that resource using HTTP methods. For example, `https://mydomain/user/123?format=json` is an endpoint that returns the user with id 123 in JSON format. A REST API should use nouns instead of verbs in the endpoints to indicate what each of them does. For example, **GET** /users should return all users, **POST** /users should create a new user, **PUT** /users/123 should update user 123, and **DELETE** /users/123 should delete user 123\n","\n","## Some of the benefits of using REST APIs are:\n","\n","* They are lightweight and fast, because they rely on the HTTP standard and can use different data formats such as JSON, XML, HTML, etc.\n","* They are independent and decoupled, because they separate the data storage and the UI from the server. This means that developers can work on different parts of a project independently and try out multiple environments as needed.\n","* They are scalable and flexible, because they can handle different types of requests and responses using HTTP methods. This also makes them easier to cache and reuse."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"3b0f3d39","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.008787,"end_time":"2023-03-03T03:41:37.616044","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-03-03T03:41:37.607257","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["##
